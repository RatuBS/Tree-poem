Sun glinted off the top of the leaves 
Chlorophiles waking up spread away
The warm oaks scent participated into my respiration
The Pea holding on branch in the damp
Such a beautiful olivewings come up
At the 5 meters of altitude whispering
It's a pigment, neither bond structure nor diet
Fluttering among flowers in the forest rain

Stomping on the wet land leaving prints
The rods of timber is sleeping
His saw from half miles away reverberating
The roars of the king
As being avid to hunt some prey 
While its eyes are reflecting the sunlight
Indeed he's born on earth to fight
Now fast deer catched up
